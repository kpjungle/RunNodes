RunNodes.py is a script for remotely starting and stopping your network devices (VM's) on your ESXi host without using the horrible VMware GUI.
I use it on my jumphost and just pass it the Names i have choosen as parameters.


So what you want to change is your names and mappings from your VMware environment. This is a one time thing and unfortunally not something i can readily automate in any way.

It is stated in the script what you need to change.


Have fun with it!
